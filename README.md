# ItemChat
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Fallen-Breath/fabric-mod-template.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)

Server-side mod allowing players to show their item in chat more cleanly, and with "x" amounts.

Showing off your items is as simple as typing '[i]' in your Chat Bar, and It will pop up with a hoverable item.

The format for showing your item in chat can also be configured via "item_chat.json" in your config folder! 

## Client or Server?

Only Required Server-side, But works in Single-player including "Open to LAN".

## Isn't There Similiar Mods?

Well yes. This is based off of similiar mods. I made this mostly as a convenience to myself and friends on our server but I decided to just share it. If you like it, awesome!
